# Mapping

This is an attempt to map out every FBS college and its scholarship offers over the last 11 years. As of now, I have 64 out of 65 Power Five teams dating back to 2011. Data collected through 247sports.com and geographic coordinates collected through the ggmap library in R.

The website is not complete and not sure when it will be but it is open with the link down below. One issue is a couple of geographic coordinates are way off, such as Milan, WI location, and will be fixed in the next couple of days.
